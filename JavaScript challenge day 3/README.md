# JavaScript Challenge Day 3:  Alternating Sums

Given an array of positive integers, return another array containing 2 integers, where the first integer is the sum of all the elements that are in odd positions and the other is the sum of all the elements that are in even positions.

### Example

Given the array `nums = [50, 60, 60, 45, 70]`, the output should be `[180, 105]` because the first value is the sum `50 + 60 + 70` and the second is the sum `60 + 45`.

# Challenge Day 4: Sum All Primes

Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors: 1 and itself.

For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2.

The provided number may not be a prime.

### Example

- The function that sums all the prime number until 10 should return `17`.

- The function that sums all the prime number until 977 should return `73156`.

# JavaScript Challenge Day 10: Max Multiple

Given a divisor and a bound, return the largest integer `N` such that:

- `N` is divisible by divisor
- `N` is less than or qual to bound.
- `N` is greater than 0.

# Note

It is guaranteed that this number exists.

### Example

Given divisor `3` and bound `10`, the output should be `9`: the largest integer divisible by '3' and not larger than '10' is '9'.

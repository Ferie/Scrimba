# JavaScript Challenge Day 5: Case Insensitive Palindrome

Given a string, check if it can become a palindrome through a case change of the letters.

### Example

- Given the female first name `Anna` as input string, the output should be `true` because 'Anna' can be read both forward (left to right) and backward (right to left). All the case sensitive options are palindromes as well: `ANNA`, `aNNa`, `AnnA`, etc are all paliondromes.

- Given the string `Abaca`, the output should be `false`: in this case, the string cannot be read the same forward and backward, this string is NOT a palindrome.
